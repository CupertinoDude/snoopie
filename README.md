# Snoopie üê∂
A (very simple) tracker for popular tracking services, provided as a Chrome web extension.

This extension only lets you know when it detects Fullstory, inspectlet or hotjar for the loaded site on the active tab in Chrome.

Software is provided as-is.

If you want to see more trackers tracked, feel free to DM me [@davidbyttow](http://twitter.com/davidbyttow)
